            <p>
              Hi there! My name is <strong>Mats</strong>, currently I'm a second year game development student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. My first year I've learned a lot about programming, from programming syntax to researching game design to working on projects as a team using version control, and I learned about databases and how to interact with them using PHP and SQL. In this portfolio I'm going to showcase some of my projects and describe some of the important concepts/technologies I've learned from them.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Beat 'em up!</h3>
                <p>In this beat 'em up game I've developed in Unity with my teammates, I was responsible for researching and implementing the player animations and make them feel smooth, I also got familiar with Unity's UI system in which I created the main menu, and I got to implement player metrics which would keep track of data we could use for balancing our game.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Bullet Hell</h3>
                <p>This Bullet Hell game I got to develop in Unity by only using scripting, I got to learn the basics of C# like how to use classes and inheritance, I tried out a new git workflow called "Gitflow", I got the chance to be the leader of our team for 1 sprint and I developed my planning and designing skills.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Space Invaders</h3>
                <p>My first school assignment was to recreate the popular arcade game <em>Space Invaders</em> using JavaScript. I learned about the IDE Visual Studio Code and Gitbash for versioncontrol. We use Gitlab as a code hosting platform and learned how to use it with Visual Studio Code by using an SSH Key to keep track of our progress. I learned about committing, pushing and pulling code and about basic programming concepts like variables, operators, data types, functions, forloops and arrays. At the end of the block you were supposed to have your own version of <em>Space Invaders</em>.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Breakout International</h3>
                <p>My second school assignment was to choose an old arcade game and remake it with a twist in the mechanics. I learned more about game design and theory like MDA analysis and for coding I dove into more complex programming concepts like classes and the AJAX library for handling communication between the database and the PHP scripts in which we would store the users name and score. I got more familiar with mySQLworkbench and entity relationships. This project I mainly focussed on creating the database and less JavaScript. Here you can play the game, reach a score, and enter your username, afterwards you can see the leaderboard and if your score is high enough you will be able to see your own name.</p>
