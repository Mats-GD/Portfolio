            <p>
              Hi there! My name is <strong>Mats</strong>, currently I'm a second year game development student at the Amsterdam University of Applies Sciences. My first year I've learned a lot about programming from programming syntax to researching game design to working on projects as a team using version control and a little bit of PHP and SQL to create and interact with databases. In this portfolio I'm going to showcase some of my first year's projects and describe what I've learned from them.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Space Invaders</h3>
                <p>My first school assignment was to recreate the popular arcade game <em>Space Invaders</em> using JavaScript. I learned about the IDE Visual Studio Code and Gitbash for versioncontrol. We use Gitlab as a code hosting platform and learned how to use it with Visual Studio Code by using a SSH Key to keep track of our progress. I learned about committing, pushing and pulling code and about basic programming concepts like variables, operators, data types, functions, forloops and arrays. At the end of the block you were supposed to have your own version of <em>Space Invaders</em>.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Breakout International</h3>
                <p>My second school assignment was to choose an old arcade game and remake it with a twist in the mechanics. I learned more about game design and theory like MDA analysis and for coding I dove into more complex programming concepts like classes and the AJAX library for handling communication between the database and the PHP scripts in which we would store the users name and score. I got more familiar with mySQLworkbench and entity relationships. This project I mainly focussed on creating the database and less JavaScript.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Energizer</h3>
                <p>My third school assignment was to create an energizer game which would be playable for multiple people at a time. The main focus of this project was again with databases but also with design theory and using projectmanaging methods like SCRUM to work as a team effectively, plan out each sprint, and set goals for each sprint. For me the most valuable lesson from this project was time managing and using a more complex programming systems like a state manager.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Bullet Hell</h3>
                <p>My fourth school assignment was to create a bullet hell game in unity using only C# scripts, we weren't allowed to use any of the click and drag features of unity like creating game objects and prefabs. The goal of this block was to become more aware of time management, getting to know C# and gathering metrics out of our game. I got more familiar with inheritance and some of the built in features like rigidbody's and a wave manager.</p>
