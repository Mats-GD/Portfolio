      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Mats, currently I'm a second year game development student at the Amsterdam University of Applies Sciences. My first year I've learned a lot about programming from programming syntax to researching game design to working on projects as a team using version control and a little bit of PHP and SQL to create and interact with databases. In this portfolio I'm going to showcase some of my first year's projects and describe what I've learned from them.

            <h3>Space Invaders</h3>
            <p>My first school assignment was to recreate the popular arcade game <em>Space Invaders</em> using JavaScript. I learned about the IDE Visual Studio Code and Gitbash for versioncontrol. We use Gitlab as a code hosting platform and learned how to use it with Visual Studio Code by using a SSH Key to keep track of our progress. I learned about committing, pushing and pulling code and about basic programming like variables, operators, data types, functions, forloops and arrays. At the end of the block you were supposed to have your own version of <em>Space Invaders</em>.</p>
